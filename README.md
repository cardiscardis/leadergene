Transforming Leadership in Africa
Leadership problems have been the doom of Africa. We are said to have everything to thrive, but our leaders couldn't stop mismanaging our resources. I want to believe that this is a result of the current state of inheritance and the non-competitiveness of leadership positions in Africa. In such environments, any wealthy or violent person can attain leadership positions easily, even without leadership abilities, through affluence or violence, at any given point in time. Yet it is in the people's hands to yield positions to anyone, regardless. This is done every one of these times through delegations or elections. However, these delegations and elections are not controllable by the people, thereby, leading to unwanted leadership consequences, as anyone, even without any leadership experience, may show up as a leadership candidate at any given time. 

This calls for a solution that enforces democratic choices in leadership amongst the people, in a more expected, predictable, and acceptable way, similar to the highly competitive process involved in staffing workers in companies. Leader Gene is a DAO application that seeks to address leadership problems by making leadership positions highly competitive and less inheritable in Africa.

The features of the leadership gene include:

1. A Solidity smart contract for members of a community to register with their ID number, house number, street name, area name, local government name, and state name fields. 

2. In the smart contract, anyone can create a group by constituency level and location. The constituency level must be a street, area, local government, or state. 

3. If the constituency level is a street, then the location must include a street name, an area name, a local government, and a state. If the constituency level is area, then the location must contain the area name, local government, and state. If the constituency level is a local government, then the location must contain a local government and a state. If the constituency level is that of a state, then the location must have a state name. 

4. Meanwhile, each community member is allowed to join only one group at each constituency level. Any member of the community may enter a particular thing he or she did to improve the community into a group he feels is more involved, and other community members within that group may accept the work as being true or false. but there must be at least 20 people in each group and 80% votes for the group to be allowed to vote for the truth of community achievement. This contribution and vote will be regarded as the leadership portfolio of the aspirants.

5. Leaders with the highest scores are the only ones allowed to debate and compete for roles starting from base (street) to top (state) without omission. 

Other possible additions are: 

a. only state leaders can compete for the presidency after some 4 years planning time away from any role, and

b. The number of possible voters can be increased based on the size of the constituency.


Explanation:
Web3 Initialization:

The script checks if MetaMask (or another Web3 provider) is available and initializes the Web3 instance.
Functions:

register(): Registers a member with the provided details.
createGroup(): Creates a group with the specified ID, constituency level, and location.
joinGroup(): Joins a group with the specified ID.
proposeAchievement(): Proposes an achievement for the specified group.
voteOnAchievement(): Votes on the truthfulness of the specified achievement for the given group.
Styling:

The CSS provides a modern and "divinely nightingale" theme with a dark background, light text, and accent colors. The form elements are styled to be visually appealing and easy to use.
Note:
Replace 'YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_HERE' with the actual contract address.
Replace the empty contractABI array with the actual ABI of your deployed contract.
This HTML document, along with the provided JavaScript code, will interact with your Solidity smart contract using Web3.js and MetaMask.
